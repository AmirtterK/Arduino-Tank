# Arduino-Tank: Williams

A simple Arduino tank running on 4 motors combined with oled display to show eyes using [Inteller Eyes Liberary](https://github.com/intellar/oled_eye_display)

The Tank Controlling App is also built by me which you can download for Android [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JX_iAuD0klklGq_APVVqvwxp9tm-qhU/view?usp=drive_link)
